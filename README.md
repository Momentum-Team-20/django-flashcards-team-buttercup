## Brief Description of the Project:

For this project, Jordan and Maria worked as a pair to build a Django app that allows users to create flashcards and quiz themselves on them. This app allows logged in users to create multiple decks of flashcards, each with a prompt or question and an answer. Logged in users can see a list of their decks and select a deck to begin a quiz on the cards in the deck. The quizzes show the user multiple cards. The user can click on a card and it will flip over to reveal an answer. The user can mark whether or not they got the answer correct.

## Notes from each Developer:

### Jordan

##### List of practiced skills:
1. Pair programming
2. Javascript
3. Debugging
4. Teamwork

##### Key takeaways:
1. "Pair programming, holy shit" -- Jordan Manus
    * It is important to be mindful regarding pair programming partner's existing knowledge base and thought process so we're both on the same page.
2. That we can and do have the knowledge to work through most problems as a team rather than immediately calling for help

##### Notable challenges:
1. Not having a discussion about how we each work at the start led to a lot of challanges in how we collaborated on the project


### Maria

##### List of practiced skills:
1. Pair programming
2. Javascript
3. Communication
4. Time management
5. Teamwork

##### Key takeaways:
1. "Pair programming, holy shit - again" -- Maria Angeles
    * Being more fearless about sharing thoughts regarding how to solve certain issues utilizing my existing knowledge base.
2. Having a second person to run through ideas, issues, bugs, etc. is really beneficial

##### Notable challenges:
1. There's a difference in experience levels and comfort with using django which can be daunting when trying to solve problems within the code

## Roadmap for what's next:
    
##### Function Fixes:
1. Add data validation to our 'right button tally' so multiple right answer clicks aren't being recorded for the same flashcard
2. Adding incorrectly guessed cards back to the queue
3. Tests
    
##### Aesthetic Fixes:
1. Make the pages overall more user friendly
2. Follow accessibility guidelines (Perfect Score website!)
3. Adding a sort function to sort decks by subjects, number of cards, alphabetically, etc.
4. Add a demo to the home page
